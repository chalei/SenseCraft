# SenseCraft - The Project of No-Code Smart Sensor Builder, This one custom tailored to support Indonesia AS923_2 Band

## Description 

SenseCraft is an open source software platform to build smart sensors with no-code. It delivers a complete out-of-the-box solution to sense the real-world, process data and send the data to the cloud in the easiest and fastest way possible with no coding experience at all! It is now compatible with Wio Terminal, and we hope it will be open and inclusive to support hardware platforms such as M5 Stack, XIAO and MCU with screen on the basis of community contribution.

With this toolkit, we’ll break down the process of displaying sensor data into 3 actions:

- Sense: Connect all the sensors to supported hardware platform 
- Process: Data handling and Machine Learning
- Uplink (Network): Sending data to the clould via WiFi/ LoRaWAN

## Supported hardware platforms

- [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html) (pilot testing hardware platform)
- [M5 Stack](https://m5stack.com) (to-be-compatible)
- [XIAO Series](https://www.seeedstudio.com/xiao-series-page) with Screens  (to-be-compatible)

Currently we have implemented several functions and they have already been tested to work well on the pilot testing hardware platform Wio Terminal. We will continue to further expand the possibilities of the current solution and ultimately end up with a more polished solution to serve the open source community. So, please stay tuned for our next update. 

## Quick start with Wio Terminal

- Step 1: Download the latest **.uf2** file [from here](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/SenseCraft/releases)

- Step 2: Connect Wio Terminal to PC and enter bootloader mode on the Wio Terminal

## Would you like to contribute to this project? 

You are all invited to experience this toolkit by downloading the Release v0.3. Feel free to propose any other functions that you’d love to have by raising an Issue. Hunting the bugs by raising issues is much appreciated. A big shout-out in advance to those who will contribute to the project.

## Development Steps

In order to get started with the development, you first need to setup a development environment on your PC. After you are done with the development, you need to compile the codes and upload to the pilot testing hardware platform Wio Terminal. All these will be explained below.

### Set up environment

Here we use the PlatformIO as the debut integrated development environment (We’re open to other IDEs and feel free to offer your suggestions). PlatformIO supports some of the most popular IDEs and text editors as an extension/ plugin. Moreover, we will use PlatformIO extension with Microsoft Visual Studio.

- Step 1: Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio Code by following [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Step 2. Open VS Code, click Extensions from the left navigation pane, type platformio in the search bar and click Install

### Build 

Now we will build the project for Wio Terminal 
 
- Step 1: Clone the following GitHub repo

```sh
https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/SenseCraft
```

- Step 2: Go into the project root directly and type the following to build the project

```sh
pio run -v
```

### Upload 

Now we will upload the project into Wio Terminal
 
- Step 1: Connect Wio Terminal to PC via USB Type-C cable 
- Step 2: Go into the previous project root directly and type the following to upload the project into Wio Terminal

```sh
pio run -t upload
```
